# Overview

This module is for additional extension in core Magento with commerce to work with PWA Studio. To provide the ability to develop the project locally we introduced a development workflow that can help external developers work with the project.

#Development setup

## Installation as a git-based composer package

1. Go to your magento2 with commerce git repository and check out the latest develop branch, e.g. 2.4-develop. You may also check out and use any 2.4 release tags.

```
cd magento2
```

2. Create an ext directory in the root of the magento2 project directory:

```
mkdir ext
```

3. Clone the magento2-pwa repository into the appropriate directory inside ext:

```
git clone git@github.com:magento-commerce/magento2-pwa-commerce.git ext/magento/magento2-pwa

```

4. Update Composer settings for the project to allow a better development workflow:

- minimum-stability for packages is updated to dev value. This allows installation of development modules:

```
  composer config minimum-stability dev
```

- To be able to work with stable packages enable the prefer-stable property: prefer-stable: true. It should be included right above the minimum-stability setting.
- Next we configure Composer so that it knows where to find new modules. The following command will configure any extension code inside the ext directory to be treated as a package and symlinked to the vendor directory:

```
  composer config repositories.ext path "./ext/*/*/*"
```

5. Finally, install the extension:

```
composer require magento/magento2-pwa-commerce
```

At this point, the module is symlinked inside the vendor directory, which allows both running a Magento installation with additional modules as well as doing development using the standard git workflow.

You may need to ensure that magento2-pwa-commerce\* modules is listed as enabled when you run bin/magento module:status. If they are, [follow the docs on how to enable modules](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/extension-dev-guide/build/enable-module.html).

### Setting up Git workflow

In order to improve the developer experience when working with this repository structure, a few additional items may be configured:

1. Exclude ext directories from root directory Git:

```
echo ext >> ./.git/info/exclude
```

2. Skip root directory composer.\* files to avoid committing them by mistake:

```
git update-index --skip-worktree composer.json
git update-index --skip-worktree composer.lock
```

This operation is reversible, if needed:

```
git update-index --no-skip-worktree composer.json
git update-index --no-skip-worktree composer.lock
```

## Cloud deployment extension installation

1. Add https://repo.magento.com as a composer repository by adding the following to your cloud instances composer.json file
```json 
"repositories": {
    "repo": {
        "type": "composer",
        "url": "https://repo.magento.com"
    }
},
```
2. Require in magento/magento2-pwa-commerce extension by adding the following to your cloud instances composer.json file
```json 
"require": {
        "magento/magento2-pwa-commerce": "0.0.1"
    },
```

3. Ensure your auth.json file has valid credential for repo.magento.com.

4. Run `composer update` to update your composer.lock file

5. Push the changes and deploy your instance.
